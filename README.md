## 📌 Overview

**SAC** (Semantic Aware Convoys) is a research code repository designed to detect moving groups of objects (convoys) that satisfy both **spatial proximity** and **semantic diversity** over time.

This repository implements algorithms to solve the *Semantic-Aware Convoy* problem, providing both exact baseline implementations and optimized approaches using grid-based indexing and incremental updates.

The core algorithms address the challenge of discovering **Relaxed Moving Clusters** (RMCs) where:
1.  **Spatial Constraint:** Objects must be density-connected (e.g., via DBSCAN-like density) at each timestamp.
2.  **Semantic Constraint:** Objects must share specific semantic attributes or satisfy interaction rules to satisfy semantic diversity.
3.  **Temporal Constraint:** The cluster must persist for at least a minimum duration ($k$ consecutive timestamps).

## 📂 Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into modules representing different algorithmic approaches to the problem:
